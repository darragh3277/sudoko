## Sorter

I've always been a fan of Sudoko and have often wondered how complex the solutions to a game must be. Over the weekend I decided to make a game for fun with the option to auto-solve. The game is build using reactJS and basic html and css. You can view sudoko here: https://darraghobrien.com/projects/sudoko

### Running Locally

Sudoko is a react app, to run locally you will need to have node installed. Clone the project to your machine, run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
